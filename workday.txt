Hi all,



Update: According to Christian Hildebrand the base for MIB3 and CNS3 is not common.

The used Testmanager branch in the CNS3 SOP2 is approximately 1 year (!) older than the version, when the needed function was introduced to the SW.

This also might apply to other modules than the TM.



Without a complete merge of those two projects MIB3 and CNS3 it will not be possible to support both from the same point.



A similar issue to the Geoblocking hits also current FBU 37W versions (SW 280+): There some functions for GNSS are not supported by the Testmanager due to version mismatch.



It is just a big mess and it will be harder and harder to keep the overview.

Even worse: Each new variant or SW we need to deal with pseudo errors, which

-	slows down frontrunner production,

-	makes the tester sequences more and more impossible to maintain and therewith error prone

-	blurs the picture to identify real problems



Long story short: Before the SW donâ€™t gets a bug-fix, holding an up-to-date TM version, no WLAN can be tested in FCT.
